In September 2012 I have visited the Association of Linux Friends in Limbe, Cameroon. A computer schooling and solar energy incubator project run by Michel Pauli. Together we have started an electronics lab with basic soldering and measurement equipment at the school, we have tought some HTML and PHP and have been mounting a solar panel on a house roof after installing solar powered lightbulbs and batteries there. This is the webpage of the fully autonomous project: http://sokolo.cronopios.org/. They are collaborating with the activist networkers at https://www.immerda.ch.
